Project: Trapper Keeper

Group Member Names: Travis Gee, Matthew Foxwell, Eric Weissman	

Goals and Expectations for the Project (What does each group member hope to get out of this project? What do we want to achieve as a team? How will we know that we're successful?):
T: Solid understanding of the concepts - Redux, Router, testing and setting up a backend.
M: Since first time working with BE, want to get a solid understanding of backend architecture.
E: Really want to solidify understanding of advanced FE concepts - Redux, Router and front-end testing. Have a basic understanding of creating and implementing a backend.

Team strengths & collaboration styles (consider discussing your Pairin qualities here):
T: Strong at keeping track of details as we complete the project. Strong at refactoring code down. Ideally would like to work on new concepts together and split up work on concepts we have familiarity with.
M: Project management and keeping tabs on the overall project and where we stand in terms of MVP vs. finished product. Prefer Driver Navigator for new concepts, and breaking out work on concepts we feel strong about. 
E: Good at project management, time mgmt and gameplanning/backwards planning from end result. Try to communicate early and often to stay on top of deadlines or ask for help. I like to do Driver Navigator when possible, or at least do some pair programming where we work on smaller chunks individually, but in the same working session.

How we can use our strengths to overcome obstacles:
Frequent progress "reports" and checkins to see where we are in terms of meeting deadlines for certain features and also having a lot of opportunities to ask for help/pair or get a second set of eyes from a group member. Keep lines of communication open so we avoid long delays on PRs, code reviews, etc. Try to prioritize splitting the work into smaller individual chunks while working in the same workspace to allow for frequent, impromptu code reviews.

Schedule Expectations (When are we available to work together and individually? What constraints do we have?):
Matt will have to make trips home around 6pm some nights (will communicate that to other group members ahead of time).
Eric would prefer to leave school before 8pm and does not prefer working super late. Comfortable working weekends and holidays.
Travis would prefer to cut down overall hours and protect some time on weekends.

Communication Expectations (How and often will we communicate? How do we keep lines of communication open? How will we make decisions as a team?):
Hold a mini-Retro (2 minutes) to just talk about how the day went, what issues we encountered (project AND interpersonal) and a quick gameplan for following day.
If you plan on working on something individually, make sure to tag the other members in Slack to let them know what you are working on to avoid duplicating work (also update on waffle.io)
Utilize Pom timers to keep track of work/break ratio.

Abilities & Growth Expectations (Technical strengths and areas for desired improvement):
T: Areas for growth: focus on improving testing. Strengths: feel confident with React and how the pieces from Redux interact.
M: Areas for growth: never worked with a backend that I created, want to walk away with a good understanding of creation/implementation.  Strengths: feeling good about how Redux and React work together.
E: Areas for growth: testing and comfort with setting up a well-structured Redux app. Strengths: decent with React architecture.

Workload Expectations (What features do we each want to work on?):
Group: setting up the backend
Individual: will determine as features/strengths become more evident.

Workflow Expectations (Git workflow/Tools/Code Review/Reviewing Pull Requests/Debugging and Problem-solving Techniques):
Utilize waffle.io to create and track issues.
Code reviews in Github to track who is reviewing what for PRs, etc.
Setting "struggle" timers and finding pairing opportunities if/when we get stuck.

Expectations for giving and receiving feedback:
Be kind (assume best intentions) but be honest. If something is bothering you/you need a break, say something.


Project management tools we will use:
POM timers
waffle.io
Github
Slack/Slack Calls
