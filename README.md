## Background/About
This application was our first attempt at creating and managing a backend to support our frontend app. We designed the backend API endpoints using Node.js and Express. We are utilizing the backend to keep track of the user's notes and associated items. On the frontend, we designed the app using React, Redux and React Router to create an easy-to-use interface that allows users to create and keep track of tasks.
